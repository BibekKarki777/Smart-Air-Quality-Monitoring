## Description

Designed and developed a Smart Air Quality Monitoring System (prototype) that leverages IoT technology, environmental sensors, and Arduino microcontrollers to provide air quality analysis. This system continuously tracks parameters such as temperature, humidity, pressure, and air pollution levels (AQI), categorizing air quality into Good, Moderate, and Poor using a color-coded LED system and audible alerts.

## Key Features

- Integration of Arduino Uno, MQ Gas Sensors, TMP36 temperature sensor, and custom pressure/humidity simulation.
- Air quality display via 16x2 LCD and alerts through LEDs and buzzer.
- Energy-efficient design with an automatic LCD backlight power-saving mechanism.
- Prototyped and simulated on Tinkercad for proof-of-concept validation.
- System logic and response modeled using Boolean expressions and logic gates.
- Aligns with UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) such as:
  - SDG 3 (Good Health)
  - SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities)
  - SDG 13 (Climate Action)

## Tools & Technologies

**Arduino C/C++**, **Tinkercad**, **IoT architecture** (Perception-Network-Application layers), **LCD**, **LEDs**, **sensors**, **power-saving modules**

## Outcome

This prototype demonstrates how affordable and scalable smart systems can help tackle air pollution, support sustainable development, and raise public awareness about environmental health in urban and indoor settings.
